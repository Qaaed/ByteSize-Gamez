üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
Prerequisites

    Node.js (v16 or later)

    npm or yarn package manager

    A Google account to create a Firebase project

Installation & Setup

    Clone the repository:
    code Bash

IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name

  

Install dependencies:
code Bash
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
npm install
# or
yarn install

  

Set up Firebase:

    Go to the Firebase Console and create a new project.

    In your project, go to Project Settings > General.

    Under "Your apps", click the web icon (</>) to register a new web app.

    Copy the firebaseConfig object that is provided.

    Enable Authentication: Go to the "Authentication" section, click "Get started", and enable the "Email/Password" sign-in provider.

    Enable Firestore Database: Go to the "Firestore Database" section, click "Create database", and start in test mode for now (you can secure it later with security rules).

Create an environment file:

    Create a file named .env.local in the root of your project.

    Copy the firebaseConfig values into this file, prefixed with REACT_APP_. It should look like this:

code Env
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

    
# .env.local
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-messaging-sender-id"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"

  

Run the development server:
code Bash

    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
    IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

        
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start

      

    The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

    Push your code to a GitHub repository.

    Connect your repository to your Vercel/Netlify account.

    Configure the environment variables (the same REACT_APP_... variables from your .env.local file) in the project settings on the deployment platform.

    Deploy! Your site will be live on the internet.

üí° Future Improvements

This project has a solid foundation, but there are always more features to add!

    In-game chat for players.

    A "spectate game" mode.

    Player profiles with match history.

    A more robust "find a match" system.
